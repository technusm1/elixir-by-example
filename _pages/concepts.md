Immutability is independent from assignments – the act of creating the relationship between variable and the value it represents. Immutability only means your values (in memory) will never be modified. It doesn not mean that the variable x will always represent the same value. Once you changed what x points to there’s no way to get the value it pointed to before (even when it might still exist in memory).
